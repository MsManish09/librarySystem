# Online Library System

## Project Description:
  A modern online library management system built with React and Vite, featuring an intuitive interface for browsing, searching, and managing books. The application uses Redux for state management and React Router for seamless navigation between pages. Users can explore books by categories, view detailed information about each book, add new books to the collection, and search through the library by title. The system includes a responsive design with category-based filtering, dynamic routing, and form validation to ensure a smooth user experience.
